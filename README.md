# Motioncoorection_Cardiac_3D_Perfusion_MRI
A deformable+rigid image registration scheme used to remove motion from cardiac time-series perfusion images. 
A rigid followed by a deformable image registration approach was used to remove motion from a series of cardiac MRI images. 
Results were compared with ANTS (registration software).
